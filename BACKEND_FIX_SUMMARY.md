# Backend Status Tracking System Fix Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **No Exception Handling**: The `run_transcription` function had no try-except block, causing tasks to get stuck at "IN_PROGRESS" when exceptions occurred.

2. **Gradio Progress Incompatibility**: The code used `gr.Progress()` in FastAPI background tasks, which is incompatible since Gradio's progress tracking only works within Gradio's UI context.

3. **No Logging**: There was no logging in the transcription router to track errors or debug issues.

4. **Memory Management**: Large audio files could cause memory issues, especially with Voxtral model loading.

5. **Progress Callback Errors**: Progress callback could fail silently, preventing status updates.

## Changes Made

### 1. backend/routers/transcription/router.py

- Added comprehensive logging throughout the transcription process
- Implemented `MockProgress` class to replace `gr.Progress()` in FastAPI context
- Added try-except blocks to `run_transcription` with proper error handling
- Added exception handling to `create_progress_callback` to prevent failures
- Added memory cleanup with `torch.cuda.empty_cache()` and `gc.collect()`
- Enhanced error tracking with full traceback logging
- Added proper status updates to FAILED when exceptions occur

### 2. modules/whisper/voxtral_whisper_inference.py

- Added `_safe_progress` method to handle both Gradio and Mock progress objects
- Replaced all direct progress calls with safe wrapper
- Added exception handling in the transcribe method
- Added logging for better error tracking
- Fixed indentation issues in the transcribe method

### 3. backend/main.py

- Added `/health` endpoint for easier backend monitoring

### 4. Additional Files Created

- `backend/routers/transcription/task_utils.py`: Utilities for checking and handling stale tasks
- `test_backend_fix.py`: Test script to verify the fixes work correctly

## How It Works Now

1. **Exception Handling**: Any exception in `run_transcription` is caught, logged with full traceback, and the task status is updated to FAILED with the error message.

2. **Progress Updates**: The `MockProgress` class safely handles progress updates in FastAPI context, logging progress instead of trying to update a non-existent UI.

3. **Memory Management**: After each transcription (successful or failed), GPU memory is cleared to prevent memory issues.

4. **Robust Progress Callback**: The progress callback now catches and logs any errors without propagating them, ensuring the main transcription process continues.

5. **Better Visibility**: Comprehensive logging provides visibility into what's happening during transcription, making debugging easier.

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fixes:

```bash
python test_backend_fix.py
```

This will:
- Check if the backend is running
- Display current task statuses
- Create a test transcription task
- Monitor its progress until completion or failure

## Benefits

1. **No More Stuck Tasks**: Tasks will properly transition to COMPLETED or FAILED states
2. **Better Error Visibility**: Full error messages and tracebacks are logged and stored
3. **Memory Efficiency**: Proper cleanup prevents memory accumulation
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging makes it easier to diagnose issues
5. **Compatibility**: Works correctly in both Gradio UI and REST API contexts
